In this project, I will be exploring the fascinating world of time series analysis and leveraging forecasting models.\n\nObjective:\nThe primary objective of this project is to forecast sales and revenue using robust forecasting models to predict future values of the time series dataset i chose. \n\nMethodology:\nMy approach involves several key steps:\n\nData Exploration and Preprocessing: I will start by exploring the dataset, identifying trends, seasonality, and any anomalies. Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, scaling, and removing outliers will be applied to ensure data quality.\n\nModel Selection: We will implement ARIMA and Holt models, which are well-established and widely used for time series forecasting. These models are capable of capturing both temporal dependencies and seasonality in the data.\n\nModel Training and Evaluation: The models will be trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Cross-validation techniques will be employed to assess model generalization.\n\nForecasting: Finally, i will leverage the trained models to generate forecasts for future time periods, providing valuable insights into the expected trends and patterns in the data.\n\nI welcome corrections, questions and collaborations.
